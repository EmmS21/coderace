# Game your Leet

A gamified platform helping users practice their coding skills through competitively solving programming challenges of a selected level of difficulty within a specified period of time

## Functionality
Users start off by selecting a level of difficulty, upon which, they will receive a continous stream of programming challenges as they continue to solve these, based on the difficulty selected. 

The code writen and run by the user will be evaluated by a custom built autograder, evaluating the correctness of the solution. If the user passes the tests, the user will be sent the next question. This process will continue until the user runs out of time.

Upon the clock running to completion, the user will receive a score, based on the number of questions solved. The user will have an option to add their name to a live leadership board. They will submit their name and photo, this will appear alongside the score they acquired and they date upon which they completed the challenge.
